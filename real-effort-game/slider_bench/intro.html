<p>
    This is a practice round. <br>
    In the slider tasks, you position sliders to exactly the midpoint (50). <br>
    If you fail to complete at least <b>5</b> sliders in <b>30</b> seconds, you will be disqualified from the game. <br>

    Here is an example of a slider positioned at 50:
    <br>
    <img src="{{ static 'global/slider_screenshot.png' }}"
         style="display: block; margin: 1rem auto 2rem auto">

    <h6> From the moment you click on "Start", you will start the slider task. You will have 30 seconds to correctly position at least 5 sliders or as many as you can.
    </h6>
