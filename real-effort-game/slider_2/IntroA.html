  </li>
  <li>
    There is another potential wage system: <b>upward-sloping</b>. It means that for each additional slider you complete, you earn <span style="color:red"> 10% more </span> than the previous slider.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b> You are currently in the <b>downward-sloping system</b>. Your current per slider wage is <span style="color:red"> 5 tokens per slider </span>. It will drop with each additional slider. </b>
