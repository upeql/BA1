<p>
      Welcome to the slider tasks. <br>
      There are 4 people in your group doing slider tasks. You have 2 rounds of slider tasks to complete. <br>
      In each round, you need to complete as many sliders as you can in 30 seconds to earn wages (tokens). <br>
      For each round, <span style="color:red"> YOU MUST COMPLETE AT LEAST 5 SLIDERS  </span> to be paid. Otherwise your response will be <span style="color:red"> REJECTED </span> and you <span style="color:red"> WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY PAYMENT </span>.<br>
      <span style="color:red"> {{ treatment2 }} </span><br>

  <u><h6> Wage Systems and Coordinating with Group Members </h6></u>
<ul>
  <li>
    As of now, the wage system is a <b>downward-sloping system</b>. It means that for each additional slider you complete, you earn <span style="color:red"> 10% less </span> than the previous slider.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is another potential wage system: upward-sloping. It means that for each additional slider you complete, you earn <span style="color:red"> 10% more </span> than the previous slider.
  </li>
  <li>
     Your starting per-slider wage is <span style="color:red"> 5 tokens </span> per slider.
  </li>
  </ul>
 <br>

     Before you start your tasks, you and your opponents may <b>collectively decide whether to change the wage system from downward-sloping to upward-sloping</b>.<br>

     <b> The wage system can change ONLY if all of you choose "Agree". </b><br>
     <br>
     <b> There is <span style="color:red"> NO COST </span> in choosing "Agree". </b><br>
     <br>
  <h6> After you click "Make your decision", you will be redirected to the decision-making page.
